Alicia is an innovative project that leverages quantum computing to generate cryptographic key pairs and keys. It utilizes IBM Quantum, Azure Quantum, or a simulated quantum backend to enhance the security of generated keys with true RNG. This project aims to demonstrate how quantum technology can be integrated into modern cybersecurity applications.

For QC hardware queries:  IBM Quantum or Azure Quantum account is necessary.

You can also use a simulation, which works without an account.

Features

-Quantum-Assisted Key Generation: Uses IBM Quantum or Azure Quantum for randomness.

-Multiple Cryptographic Algorithms: Supports RSA, ECC, AES, DES, 3DES, and SSH key generation.

-Flask-Based Web Interface: Simple and interactive UI for key generation.

-Quantum Simulator Support: Allows testing without requiring quantum hardware.

-Secure Key Storage & Retrieval: Outputs keys in a secure and standardized format, and keys are generated locally.

Instructions: 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements.
