Alicia leverages quantum computing to generate cryptographic key pairs and keys. It utilizes IBM Quantum or Azure Quantum providers to enhance the security of generated keys with true RNG. A simulated quantum backend was also added to demonstrate functionality. 


-Supports RSA, ECC, AES, DES, 3DES, and SSH

-Outputs keys in a secure and standardized format.

-Keys are generated locally.
