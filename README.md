Alicia leverages quantum computing to generate cryptographic key pairs and keys. It utilizes IBM Quantum, Azure Quantum, or a simulated backend to enhance the security of generated keys with true RNG. This project aims to demonstrate how quantum technology can be integrated into modern cybersecurity applications.

-Supports RSA, ECC, AES, DES, 3DES, and SSH

-Outputs keys in a secure and standardized format.

-Keys are generated locally.
